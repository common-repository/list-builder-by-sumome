The tool that can double your email newsletter subscribers.  Our MailChimp newsletter subscribe popover asks visitors to subscribe to your newsletter.

== Description ==

[Note: In addition to MailChimp, this plugin also works for Aweber, GetResponse, Constant Contact, and Campaign Monitor.]

Each day, potential readers visit your website.  The find a link to your blog somewhere, read one of your posts, and then disappear into some distant corner of the internet.

With the List Builder plugin, you can convert these one-time visitors into lifelong readers and newsletter subscribers.

Our lightbox popover can be customized to automatically popup after a certain amount of time, or you can use our smart mode to ask your visitors to subscribe when we think they're getting ready to leave your website.

Now, people will find your blog, read your article, and subscribe via email to your MailChimp newsletter.

= List Builder (email subscribe feature) =

The visitors to your website contribute a lot of value, but the real gold is in your email newsletter list.  These are the readers who see all of your new articles, share your website with their friends, and might even buy your products.

To help you build your valuable email subscribers, List Builder has been specially designed to convert a high number of visitors to newsletter subscribers.  Each time a visitor comes to your website, the List Builder plugin invites them to join your email list.

Through our integrations with MailChimp, Aweber, Constant Contact, and Campaign Monitor, you can easily and automatically add these new subscribers to your newsletter system of choice.  Alternately, you can simply export the collected email addresses in CSV format.

With List Builder turning visitors into MailChimp subscribers, you will soon see a dramatic increase in your newsletter size.

= Manually set timing on your popover =

The List Builder email subscription popup can be easily set to load after a certain number of seconds.  For instance, you can make the plugin load after just 1 second if you want to catch potential subscribers as they enter your website.  If you'd rather let them look around before asking for a subscription, you can set the popover to load after a longer time - like 15 seconds.

= Or use our smart timing =

Sometimes you might not want to ask for an email address when your visitor is in the middle of reading your article.  If you don't want to interrupt their reading, you can use the smart timing setting to make the newsletter popover automatically load only when we think your visitor is getting ready to leave. With the smart setting, new visitors can finish your post, and we'll offer an email newsletter subscription only when they're on the way out.

= Connect with major email newsletter companies =

You can easily connect our newsletter List Builder with all major email companies.  Aweber, MailChimp, Constant Contact, and Campaign Monitor will all automatically accept your new subscribers.

Just choose which newsletter company you use and follow the simple steps to authorize a connection (for instance, this takes about three clicks for MailChimp).

If you don't want to connect with MailChimp, Aweber, Constant Contact, or Campaign Monitor, you can simply use our CSV format to download all email subscribers for your newsletter.

= Quickly customize design =

Our email newsletter popover can be easily modified.  You can edit the wording, confirmation message, and even colors to match the tone and design of your website.  By maintaining a mental cohesion between the popover and your website, you can actually improve the number of email subscribers you get.

= Or edit the raw html =

If the customization option doesn't meet your needs, you can actually edit the raw html to make the List Builder do whatever you need.  This gives you full power to optimize completely for your target email subscribers.
